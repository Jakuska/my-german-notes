# Modal verbs

Modal verbs are helping verbs. They indicate the desire, possibility, constraint of the verb. 

can - können
may - dürfen
must - müssen
should - sollen
will - werden
want - möchten
like - mögen 

The modal verb is conjugated and the main verb is moved to the end and is in infinitve form. 
In english, the modal verb precedes the main verb.

English: Tom must go to work tomorrow (go is after must)
German: Tom muss morgen zur Arbeit gehen (gehen is at the end and muss is the third person, singular form of müssen)

When the main verb is obvious, it is sometimes omitted. For example: Ich kann Deutsch (no need to add sprechen)  

In English, modal verbs come before the main verb (except for questions). In German, modal verbs are in second place and the main verb is placed at the end.w
"You should go home and lie down." vs "Du solltest nach Hause gehen und dich hinlegen."
"I can't sing" vs "Ich kann nicht singen"
