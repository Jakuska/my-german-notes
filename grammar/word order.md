# Word order

English is a SVO language because in a normal, declarative sentence we follow the subject then verb then object formula. 
It being SVO language does not mean that all the sentences must follow this order.
For example: I like pizza. There is a different order for questions: Do you like pizza? And order can be changed for emphasis: Pizza - I like (for exmaple to emphasis that I like Pizza but not the other things).

German is a V2 language. 

This is because the verb takes the second place. However, in German the second verb goes to the end. 

I have eaten Hawaiian pizza
Ich habe hawaiianische Pizza gegessen
